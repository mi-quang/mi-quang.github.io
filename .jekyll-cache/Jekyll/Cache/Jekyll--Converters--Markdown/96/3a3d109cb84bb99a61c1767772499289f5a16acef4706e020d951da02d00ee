I"L<p>Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an essentially self-adjoint operator with respect to the $\sigma$-finite measure $\mu$ of the measurable space $(E, \mathcal{F})$.  By spectral theory, $\mathcal{L}$ is uniquely associated with a self-adjoint strongly continuous contraction semigroup $(P_t)<em>{t \in \mathbb{R}</em>+}$ on $L^2(E,\mu)$.</p>
