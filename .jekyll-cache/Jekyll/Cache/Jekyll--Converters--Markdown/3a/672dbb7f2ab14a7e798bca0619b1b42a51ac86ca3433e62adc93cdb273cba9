<p>In this note, our goal is to explain the extension this semigroup beyond \($\) space, focusing on constructing corresponding semigroups \($\) for \($\) spaces using the interpolation theorem.

<p>Let \($\) be Banach space (which for us will be the spaces \($\) )</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> A family \($\) of bounded operators on \($\) is called a contraction semigroup if</p>

  <li>\($\) and \($\) for all \($\).</li>
  <li>\($\) for all \($\) and \($\).

<p>Given a strongly continuous contraction semigroup \($\)  there is always an unbounded operator \($\) that ‚Äúgenerates‚Äù \($\)</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> There always exits a closed, densely defined operator \($\) such that \($\)  with \($\). This operator is called the genrator of \($\).</p>

<p>The following theorem is due to Hille-Yoshida, which explains when a densely  defined closed operator \($\) generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> A densely defined closed operator generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup if and only if:</p>

  <li>\($\).</li>
  <li>\($\) for all \($\).
where the spectrum \($\) of \($\) is the set of all \($\) such that \($\) is not bijective.</li>

<p><strong>Definition</strong> The self-adjoint operator \($\) of a densely defined operator \($\)   is the unique operator defined on \($\)  such that:

An operator is said to be self-adjoint if its adjoint is itsself.</p>

<p><em>Remark:</em> By definition, if \($\) is symmetric i.e. \($\) for all \($\),  \($\) is then an extension of \($\).</p>

<p>In the above discussion, we see that Hille-Yoshida‚Äôs theorem provides a method to characterize generators of contraction semigroup. When restricted to Hilbert spaces, we have another characterization using spectral theory.</p>

<h2 id="extension-of-an-self-adjoint-operator-in-">Extension of an self-adjoint operator in \($\)</h2>

<p>In this part, we prove the firstly mentioned proposition:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition</strong> Let \($\) be a self-adjoint contraction operator on \($\) that satisfies the submarkov property i.e. \($\) if \($\) and \($\). Then, there is a unique family of contraction operators \($\) such that \($\) on \($\). i.e.</p>

<ul>
  <li>\($\) for all \($\)</li>
  <li>\($\)  for all \($\), \($\).</li>
  <li>\($\)  for all  \($\).</li>
</ul>

<p>We begin with giving the Riesz-Thorin interpolation principle,</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Let \($\) and a parameter \($\) Define \($\) by \($\) and \($\). If \($\) is a linear map such that \($\) are bounded with \($\). Then, \($\) extends uniquely as bounded map \($\) and \($\).</p>

<p><em>Proof of Proposition</em></p>

<p>We know that for all \($\), \($\) is dense \($\).
Moreover, the submarkov property also implies that \($\) on \($\) . Besides, \($\) is a contraction map on \($\). Therefore, \($\). Thus, by Riesz-Thorin interpolation principle, for each \($\),  \($\) extends uniquely to an operator on \($\) and \($\).</p>

<p>For any \($\), let \($\) be defined by \($\). For any \($\), by the self-adjointness of \($\) and H√∂lder‚Äôs inequality, one has:
\($$\)
Hence, by duality, \($\). Thus, we imply the desired conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary</strong>  \($\) for all \($\) and \($\) with \($\)</p>

<h2 id="ultracontractivity-and-exponential-decay">Ultracontractivity and exponential decay</h2>

<p>In this part, we discuss the convergence of \($\).</p>

<p><em>Proof of the second proposition</em></p>

<p>For all \($\) and \($\), due to the ultracontractivity and Poincar√©‚Äôs inequality, we have:</p>

<p>\($$\)
Thus, there is a constant \($\) such that for all \($\) and \($\), \($$\)
Besides, by the self-adjointness \($\), for all \($\),
\($$\)
Hence, for all \($\),
\($$\)
Thus, by Riesz-Thorin interpolation, for all \($\), \($\) and \($\),
\($$\)
The conclusion then comes from the density of \($\) in \($\) for all \($\).</p>

<h2 id="digression-">Digression: \($\)</h2>

<p>In this section, we will prove the following result:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition</strong>
Let \($\) be a finite measure and  \($\) be a bounded operator such that \($\). Then, if  \($\) is symmetric, \($\).</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>
Indeeds, for any \($\), we have:
\($$\)
Thus, \($\) for all \($\). Hence, \($\).
On the other hand,

Hence, the conclusion.</p>

<h1 id="worked-examples">Worked examples</h1>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> (Brownian motion \($\))
The semigroup \($\) of a standard Brownian motion in \($\) has the following forms:
\($$\)
whose its unique invariant measure (up to a constant factor) is the Lebesque measure \($\). 
It is clear that for all \($\), \($$\)
Hence, the semigroup of a Brownian motion is ultracontractive.
Besides, it is clear that \($\) and \($$\)
Hence, \($\) is extendable to a family of contraction semigroups on \($\) with \($\) after interpolation principle. i.e.,
\($$\)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, this semigroup does not satisfies any Poincare‚Äôs inequality.
Indeeds, let us consider the function \($\) for some real constant \($\) .Then, \($\) 
Thus, for any even continuous compactly supported function \($\) such that \($\), if we consider the function \($\), we observe that</p>

<ul>
  <li>\($\).</li>
  <li>By Plancherel‚Äôs theorem, \($\).</li>
  <li>\($\)  <br />
Hence, by Plancherel‚Äôs theorem again, we have:</li>
  <li>\($\).</li>
  <li>\($\)
Which shows concretely that we cannot construct a Poincare‚Äôs inequality for this Brownian motion semigroup.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> (Orstein-Uhlenbeck process)
Let \($\) be the semigroup of the Orstein-Uhlenbeck process \($\) driven by a Brownian motion \($\):
\($$\)
This SDE has the analytic solution:
\($$\)
or
\($$\)
for a time-changed Brownian motion of \($\).
The generator \($\) of \($\) is then \($\), and for any \($\),
\($$\)
Its invarant measure is then \($\).
Clearly, \($\) is not ultra-contractive. Indeeds, by considering the function \($\), we observer that for any \($\), \($\), wheareas,
\($$\)
Thus, \($\).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, \($\) satisfies the Poincare‚Äôs inequality in \($\) for \($\), indeed, the Gaussian Poincar√©‚Äôs inequality show that for any standard normal variable \($\) and differentiable function \($\):
\($$\)
which implies that for any centered smooth compactly supported function \($\),
\($$\)
The last equation is due the fact that \($\) is the generator of \($\).
Hence, for all \($\) and \($\),
\($$\)
<strong>Example 3</strong> (Brownian motion in circle (\($\)))
We now consider the Brownian motion \($\) on a circle and show that this Brownian motion is ultracontractive and satisfies Pointcar√©‚Äôs inequality.
A Brownian motion \($\) in circle when embedded in \($\), is a \($\)-valued stochastic process that can be rewritten as:
\($$\)
where \($\) is a standard Brownian motion.
Because, a circle is isometric to a flat torus \($\), we may also write \($\) \($\), where \($\) denotes the projection of a real number \($\) into the quotient space \($\)
To study this Brownian motion, we will also identify \($\) with \($\). We also  identify a continuous function \($\) on \($\) with a function \($\) that is extendable to a continuous function on \($\),i.e. \($\) . Thus, by default, all the smooth functions on \($\) we considered in the rest of this example are extendable to a smooth periodic function on \($\), i.e., \($\) for all \($\).</p>

<p>Let \($\) be the semigroup associated to \($\), then for all  smooth \($\)
\($$\)
whose generator \($\) is: \($\). The unique invariant measure of \($\) is the Lebesque measure on \($\).</p>

<p>Clearly, \($\) is ultracontractive because \($\) with 
\($$\)
and \($\) for all \($\).
Besides, by for any \($\)-periodic smooth function \($\), we have:
\($$\)
Besides, using Fourrier series, we know that whenever \($\),
\($$\)
Hence, for all \($\),
\($$\)
Thus, there exists a constant \($\) such that for all \($\)  such that \($\) and \($\),
\($$\)
<em>Remark</em>: If \($\) is only a differentiable function such that \($\), i.e., we do not assume \($\). Then, we only have:
